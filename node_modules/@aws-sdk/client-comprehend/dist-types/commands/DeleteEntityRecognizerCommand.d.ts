/**
 * <p>Deletes an entity recognizer.</p>
 *          <p>Only those recognizers that are in terminated states (IN_ERROR, TRAINED) will be deleted.
 *       If an active inference job is using the model, a <code>ResourceInUseException</code> will be
 *       returned.</p>
 *          <p>This is an asynchronous action that puts the recognizer into a DELETING state, and it is
 *       then removed by a background job. Once removed, the recognizer disappears from your account
 *       and is no longer available for use. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ComprehendClient, DeleteEntityRecognizerCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-comprehend"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ComprehendClient, DeleteEntityRecognizerCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-comprehend"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ComprehendClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteEntityRecognizerCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteEntityRecognizerCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteEntityRecognizerCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ComprehendClientResolvedConfig | config} for ComprehendClient's `config` shape.
